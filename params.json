You can find sources on my GitHub (@streeetspirit).\r\nI like games and like to learn things, so I'm learning Unity 3D and how to create games.\r\n\r\nAnother passion of mine is music - I play piano and create electronic sound. Though you won't find any of my experiments in music on the Internet yet, I hope to fix that in the near future.\r\nIn the meantime take a look at my photos on [Flickr] (https://www.flickr.com/photos/marie_shoots/) if you wish!\r\n\r\n### Unity 3D projects\r\n\r\n_All of this projects were created as a part of a learning process. My main source of education were courses by Ben Tristem and his team on Udemy platform, as well as learning materials on Unity official website _\r\n\r\n[Desert Garden Invasion] (https://streeetspirit.github.com/web_builds/DesertGardenWebGL/)\r\n<p>This is a variation on Plants vs. Zombies game.
