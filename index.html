<p>I'm Masha and this is a home to some of my personal projects. You can find sources on my GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/streeetspirit" class="user-mention">@streeetspirit</a>).
I like games and like to learn things, so I'm learning Unity 3D and how to create games.</p>

<p>Another passion of mine is music - I play piano and create electronic sound. Though you won't find any of my experiments in music on the Internet yet, I hope to fix that in the near future.
In the meantime take a look at my photos on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/marie_shoots/">Flickr</a> if you wish!</p>

<p>_All of this projects were created as a part of a learning process. My main source of education were courses by Ben Tristem and his team on Udemy platform, as well as learning materials on Unity official website_</p>
        <p>Be patient while the game is loading - WebGL builds in Unity 3D still are pretty far from being small!</p>
